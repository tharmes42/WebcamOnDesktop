# WebcamOnDesktop
Your webcam on desktop as a free floating always on top window. Perfect for using it in presentations, recordings or webinars. It stays on top even in fullscreen mode (e.g. presentation mode in Powerpoint).

## Download
Download [the windows app at Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NWR1L09C54Z) or get sources at the [Release page](https://github.com/tharmes42/WebcamOnDesktop/releases/latest)

## Compatibility
If the webcam is compatible with the default Windows Camera App it will work with WebcamOnDesktop as well. It is confirmed to work with Microsoft Teams, Zoom and GotoWebinar. In theory every program that can capture at screen level should work :). 

## Screenshots
Start by first selecting your camera and second clicking on "Show camera"

## Thoughts
I wrote this program (and its predecessor [vCamDesk](https://github.com/tharmes42/vCamDesk)) because a lot of tools have some kind of silly webcam display if I make demos and screenrecordings. Though I am a big fan of OBS Studio I searched for an alternative. OBS is in some cases overkill and sometimes I don't notice when my webcam is on top of content from my screen. To avoid this, a free movable webcam window was what I needed :)
