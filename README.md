# WebcamOnDesktop
Your webcam on desktop as a free floating always on top window, like the picture-in-picture video mode (pip mode) known from iOS or YouTube. Perfect for using it in presentations, recordings or webinars. It stays on top even in fullscreen mode (e.g. presentation mode in Powerpoint).

## Download
Get sources at the [Release page](https://github.com/tharmes42/WebcamOnDesktop/releases/latest)
or ~~Download [the windows app at Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9NWR1L09C54Z)~~

**Note**: Microsoft has removed my app from their store with following reason:
>10.1.4.4 App Quality - Content	
>Your product must offer unique lasting value, such as interaction and variety.
>
>Content offered provides little value or variety.
>Tested devices: Microsoft Surface Laptop

My answer on that was:
>I see, that there are no fancy features in this app. But there is no build in feature in windows that is getting this job done to just put the camera consistently on top of every open program. So yes, this tool is boring and the idea is not unique, but it works and people are using it - all over the world. Please have a look at the ratings and comments. 

So far, I was not able to change their mind because this was just reponded with the same copy&paste text again.

## Feature requests or problems
Please use the [Issues-Section](https://github.com/tharmes42/WebcamOnDesktop/issues) to request features or report problems. Thanks in advance!

## Compatibility
If the webcam is compatible with the default Windows Camera App it will work with WebcamOnDesktop as well. It is confirmed to work with Microsoft Teams, Zoom and GotoWebinar. In theory every program that can capture at screen level should work :). 

## Screenshots
Start by first selecting your camera and second clicking on "Show camera"

## Thoughts
I wrote this program (and its predecessor [vCamDesk](https://github.com/tharmes42/vCamDesk)) because a lot of tools have some kind of silly webcam display if I make demos and screenrecordings. Though I am a big fan of OBS Studio I searched for an alternative. OBS is in some cases overkill and sometimes I don't notice when my webcam is on top of content from my screen. To avoid this, a free movable webcam window was what I needed :)
